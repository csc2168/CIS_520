Please see our project report.  Here is a link to a video demonstrating the FCN sign recognition in action.

The video is taken from Princeton, NJ.  The video was subsampled to 5 frames per second.  One can see here that the sign recognition algorithm is working.  It will find distant and proximal signs.  One can also see that when a sign is occluded, it will recognize a smaller sign.  The training set is German traffic signs, whereas here they are US traffic signs, so the match is best when the sign is an international sign such as pedestrian crossing.
