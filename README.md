Please see our project report.  Here is a link to a video demonstrating the FCN sign recognition in action.

The video is taken from Princeton, NJ, driving from Rider College through town.  The video was subsampled to 5 frames per second.  One can see here that the sign recognition algorithm is working.  One can see examples around 4 min of recognition of international signs such as pedestrian crossing.  At a traffic light one can see that the car infront is ignored but the sign is recognized. 

It will find distant and proximal signs and signs of different size.  One can also see that when a sign is occluded, it will recognize a smaller sign.  The training set is German traffic signs, whereas here they are US traffic signs, so the match is best when the sign is an international sign such as pedestrian crossing and stop signs.
